# light-on-off
This task was done for the internship at Invochain.

This Application contains a single button to turn on/off light which is stored as a parameter in the database.

This App is based on Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB and EJS.

There is one button which changes according to the condition if:-
1. The Light is on It shows TURN OFF
2. The light is off it shows TURN ON

The mongoose Object is also displayed in the Screen which clearly reflects the data in the Database.
